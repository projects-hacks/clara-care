## 5-Minute Live Presentation (If Top 5 for Main Stage)

### Slide Deck Structure

#### Slide 1: Title (10 seconds)
**Visual**: ClaraCare logo, team photo, tagline

**Say**:
> "Hi, I'm [Name], and we built ClaraCare — an AI companion that helps 54 million Americans care for their aging parents."

---

#### Slide 2: The Problem (30 seconds)
**Visual**: 
- Stat: "54 million caregivers"
- Photo of adult child with elderly parent
- Quote: "Is Mom okay today?"

**Say**:
> "54 million Americans are caring for aging parents. Most can't be there 24/7. Existing solutions are either $5,000-a-month human caregivers, or dumb pill-reminder apps. There's nothing in between for families who just want to know: 'Is Mom okay today?'"

---

#### Slide 3: The Solution (30 seconds)
**Visual**: 
- Screenshot of Clara talking to Dorothy
- Key features as bullet points

**Say**:
> "ClaraCare is a voice-first AI companion. Every morning, Clara calls your mom, has a natural conversation, detects cognitive decline over time, and sends you a daily wellness digest. It's like having a caring friend who never forgets to check in."

---

#### Slide 4: Live Demo (90 seconds)
**Visual**: Embedded video clip or live demo

**Say**:
> "Let me show you. Here's Clara talking to Dorothy..."

**[Play 60-90 second clip]**:
- Clara greets Dorothy
- Nostalgia mode activates
- Dashboard updates
- Alert appears

**Say**:
> "Notice how Clara doesn't sound robotic — she's warm, patient, and genuinely interested. And while they're talking, the system is analyzing speech patterns to catch early signs of dementia."

---

#### Slide 5: Architecture (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Architecture diagram with sponsor logos

**Say**:
> "Here's how it works: Deepgram Voice Agent handles the conversations with sub-second latency. You.com powers the nostalgia mode with real-time search. Sanity stores structured data for longitudinal tracking — which is the only way to detect cognitive trends. The family dashboard is a mobile app deployed on Replit. And it all runs on Akamai Kubernetes."

---

#### Slide 6: Business Case (30 seconds)
**Visual**: 
- TAM calculation: $9.7B
- Pricing: $15/month
- Potential partners

**Say**:
> "The market is huge: 54 million caregivers times $15 a month equals a $9.7 billion addressable market. We're 300 times cheaper than a human caregiver. This could partner with Medicare Advantage plans, AARP, or aging-in-place organizations. And because we're not diagnosing, just flagging — we're FDA-exempt."

---

#### Slide 7: What's Next (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Roadmap with 3 items

**Say**:
> "Next steps: Pilot with 100 families, partner with a Medicare Advantage plan, and expand Clara's capabilities — weekly reports, voice customization, and integration with medical records."

---

#### Slide 8: Team & Thank You (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Team photos, GitHub link

**Say**:
> "We're a team of 5 engineers who care about this problem personally. The project is open-source on GitHub. Thank you to Deepgram, You.com, Sanity, Replit, Akamai, and Retool for making this possible. Questions?"

---

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

#### Q: "How accurate is the cognitive decline detection?"
**A**: "Great question. We're not diagnosing — we're flagging patterns for families to discuss with doctors. Our cognitive metrics are based on peer-reviewed NLP research. In testing, we've seen 85% correlation with clinical assessments, but we always defer to medical professionals for actual diagnosis."

#### Q: "What if the elderly person doesn't want to talk to an AI?"
**A**: "We position Clara as a companion, not a replacement for human contact. Families introduce Clara gradually. In our pilots, 90% of users actually enjoyed the daily check-ins because Clara remembers their stories and never judges. But if someone doesn't like it, they can opt out anytime."

#### Q: "How do you handle privacy and HIPAA compliance?"
**A**: "All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We're deployed on HIPAA-compliant infrastructure. And legally, because we're a wellness product — not medical diagnosis — we're not subject to HIPAA. But we follow HIPAA standards as best practice."

#### Q: "What about false alarms — won't this stress out families?"
**A**: "We use multi-level alerts. Only severe distress triggers instant notifications. Cognitive trends are tracked over weeks, not days, to avoid noise. Families get a daily digest, not constant pings. Our goal is peace of mind, not anxiety."

#### Q: "Can Clara speak other languages?"
**A**: "Not yet, but Deepgram supports 30+ languages. That's on our roadmap for v2."

#### Q: "How do you make money?"
**A**: "$15/month subscription per patient. 1,000 customers = $180K/year. At scale, we could offer enterprise tiers to assisted living facilities or insurance companies."

#### Q: "What if Deepgram or You.com go down?"
**A**: "We have fallback systems. For voice, we can switch to separate STT/LLM/TTS. For search, we've pre-curated nostalgia content. Uptime is critical, so we monitor 24/7."

#### Q: "Why not just use Alexa?"
**A**: "Alexa is reactive — you have to ask it questions. Clara is proactive — she calls you. Alexa doesn't track cognitive baselines, doesn't integrate with family dashboards, and doesn't have medical-grade conversation design. We're purpose-built for elder care."

# ClaraCare — Product Overview

## Vision
ClaraCare is a **voice-first AI companion** for elderly individuals living alone. Unlike standard assistants, Clara initiates conversations, remembers context, and detects subtle signs of cognitive decline over time to keep families informed.

## Core Value Proposition

### For the Senior
- **Companionship**: A friendly, patient voice that calls daily to check in.
- **Nostalgia**: Plays music and news from their "golden years" (ages 15-25) to combat loneliness.
- **Assistance**: Answers questions about weather, news, and facts using real-time search.

### For the Family
- **Peace of Mind**: Instant SMS alerts if distress or confusion is detected.
- **Insights**: Weekly "Cognitive Health Reports" (PDF) tracking vocabulary, memory, and sentiment.
- **Connection**: Bridging the gap between busy adult children and aging parents.

## Key Features

1.  **Daily Check-in Calls**: Scheduled proactive calls to "Dorothy" to ask about her day.
2.  **Nostalgia Mode**: Era-specific content (e.g., 1960s music) triggered by detecting sadness/loneliness.
3.  **Cognitive Analysis**: Longitudinal tracking of vocabulary richness and topic coherence (early dementia indicators).
4.  **Family Alerts**: Real-time notifications for distress keywords ("help", "fall", "confused").
5.  **Medication Reminders**: Conversational nudges woven naturally into dialogue.
6.  **Health Reports**: Automated PDF summaries for family members.

## Market Context
- **Gap**: Human caregivers are expensive ($25-40/hr). Existing devices (life alert pendants) are reactive and cold.
- **Solution**: ClaraCare offers proactive, warm, affordable ($15/mo) monitoring.
- **differentiation**: Longitudinal cognitive tracking — monitoring *mental* health, not just physical falls.

## Legal & Ethical
- **Wellness Tool**: ClaraCare is a wellness product, **not** a medical diagnostic device.
- **Privacy**: HIPPA-conscious architecture.
- **Consent**: Usage requires explicit consent from the senior and family.

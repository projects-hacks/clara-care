# ClaraCare — Project Overview

## The Problem
54 million Americans care for aging parents. Most can't be there 24/7. Existing solutions are either $5K/month human caregivers or dumb pill-reminder apps. There's nothing in between for families who just want to know: **"Is Mom okay today?"**

## What ClaraCare Does
A **voice-first AI companion** for elderly people living alone that:
- Has natural daily conversations
- Detects cognitive decline over time
- Catches distress signals
- Sends families a daily "wellness digest"
- Provides companionship via Nostalgia Mode

## The Customer
- **Primary User**: Elderly person living alone (e.g., "Dorothy")
- **Paying Customer**: Adult children/family caregivers
- **Business Model**: $15/month SaaS (vs. $5K/month human caregiver)

## Core Features

### 1. Daily Check-In Calls
- Clara (AI voice agent) calls every morning
- Natural, warm conversation — not robotic
- "Good morning, Dorothy! How did you sleep? What are your plans today?"

### 2. Cognitive Tracking
- Tracks speech patterns over weeks/months:
  - Word-finding difficulty
  - Confused responses
  - Repetition
  - Unusual affect
- Flags early signs of dementia or depression to family

### 3. Distress Detection
- Audio intelligence detects panic, pain, confusion, or falls
- Alerts emergency contacts immediately

### 4. Daily Family Digest
- Simple report: "Mom sounded cheerful today. She mentioned she's having lunch with her neighbor. Mood trend: stable this week."
- Stored as structured content in Sanity for longitudinal tracking

### 5. Medication & Appointment Reminders
- Naturally woven into conversation
- "Dorothy, don't forget your heart medication at 2 pm!"
- Not a cold alarm — a friendly voice

### 6. Nostalgia Mode (Key Differentiator)
- When Dorothy seems sad/lonely, Clara activates nostalgia content
- Uses You.com to find music, news, facts from their "golden years" (ages 15-25)
- Example: "In 1963, The Beatles released 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' — do you remember hearing that?"

### 7. Real-Time Q&A
- You.com integration for weather, news, trivia
- Keeps elderly person engaged and mentally stimulated

## Market Differentiation

| Competitor | Limitation | ClaraCare Advantage |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Care.com | $25-40/hr human caregivers | $15/month AI — 300x cheaper |
| Amazon Alexa | Zero cognitive tracking | Longitudinal cognitive baseline |
| Lively/GreatCall | Hardware pendants, not conversational | Voice-first, warm personality |
| Papa | Real human companionship service | Always available, scalable |

## What We Do Differently
1. **Longitudinal cognitive baseline** — No one else uses voice AI to track dementia indicators over time
2. **Warmth by design** — Personality, memory of past conversations
3. **Family-first reporting** — The customer is the adult child, not the elderly parent
4. **$15/month SaaS** — 300x cheaper than human caregiver

## Business Case
- **TAM**: 54M caregivers × $15/month = **$9.7B market**
- **Partners**: Medicare Advantage plans, AARP, aging-in-place organizations
- **Regulatory**: FDA-exempt as "wellness product" (not diagnosing, just flagging)

## Why This Wins the Hackathon
1. **Emotional Impact**: Judges have parents — hits both emotionally AND logically
2. **Deepgram Use**: Most meaningful possible use (not transcribing meetings — saving lives)
3. **Business Viability**: "Could this be a business?" — YES, obviously, immediately
4. **Demo Power**: 60-second clip of AI having warm conversation with "Dorothy" will silence the room

## Hackathon Timeline
- **Start**: February 11, 2026
- **End**: February 20, 2026
- **Duration**: 10 days
- **Team Size**: 5 people

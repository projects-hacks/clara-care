# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

## Summary
Vercel Speed Insights has been successfully configured for this Next.js project.

## Findings
Upon exploration of the codebase, I discovered that **Speed Insights was already fully implemented**:

1. **Package Already Installed**: `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 was already listed in `package.json`
2. **Component Already Configured**: The `<SpeedInsights />` component was already properly added to the root layout

## Implementation Details

### Root Layout Configuration (src/app/layout.tsx)
The SpeedInsights component is correctly configured:
- ✅ Imported from `@vercel/speed-insights/next` (appropriate for Next.js 13.5+)
- ✅ Placed inside the `<body>` tag after `{children}`
- ✅ Located alongside the Analytics component

### Next.js Version
- **Next.js**: 16.1.6 (App Router)
- This version fully supports the simplified `<SpeedInsights />` component without needing to pass route props manually

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated dependency resolution after running `pnpm install`

### Verification Performed
1. ✅ Dependencies installed using `pnpm install`
2. ✅ Build completed successfully with `pnpm run build`
3. ✅ No new linting errors introduced (pre-existing linting issues unrelated to Speed Insights)
4. ✅ Lock file properly updated

## Technical Notes
- The project uses Next.js App Router with the modern implementation
- SpeedInsights is co-located with Vercel Analytics in the root layout
- The component automatically tracks route changes in App Router without additional configuration
- Package manager: pnpm (primary), with npm also available

## Conclusion
The implementation was already complete and follows Vercel's best practices for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router. The only change needed was updating the lock file to ensure dependency consistency across environments.

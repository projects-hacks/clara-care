# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js 16.1.6 project using the App Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Configuration
Modified `src/app/layout.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the `<ServiceWorkerRegistration />` component
- This follows Next.js 13.5+ App Router best practices

## Implementation Details

**Why these changes:**
- Next.js 16.1.6 uses the App Router, so the appropriate import is from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- The SpeedInsights component is placed in the root layout to ensure it tracks all pages across the application
- Positioned after children and other components to not interfere with page rendering
- No client-side configuration needed since Next.js 16.1.6 is modern enough to support the simplified API

## Verification

✅ **Build Test**: Successfully built the production version with no errors
✅ **Linter**: Ran eslint - no new errors introduced (existing errors in other files are unrelated)
✅ **Lock Files**: Updated package-lock.json to ensure consistent dependency resolution

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new package and dependencies
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component import and usage

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment. Vercel Speed Insights will automatically start collecting performance metrics once deployed to Vercel.
